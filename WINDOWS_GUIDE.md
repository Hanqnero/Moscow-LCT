# Windows Quick Start Guide

## Overview
This project is now fully portable and works on Windows! All paths are relative, so you can place the project anywhere on your system.

## Batch File Launchers

We've created easy-to-use batch files for Windows users. Simply double-click to run:

### 🚀 Main Application
**`start_app.bat`** - Launch the main web interface
- One-click access to both detection systems
- Automatic dependency checking
- Opens in your default browser

### 🌳 Detection Applications

**`start_simple_detection.bat`** - Simple tree detection
- Quick tree counting
- Basic tree identification
- Fast processing

**`start_two_stage.bat`** - Two-stage detection (trees + defects)
- Advanced tree detection
- 12 defect types
- Tree health analysis

### 🏋️ Training Scripts

**`train_trees.bat`** - Train tree detection model
- Trains on dataset/data.yaml
- CPU-optimized settings
- ~10 epochs

**`train_defects.bat`** - Train defect detection model
- Trains on defects/dataset/data.yaml
- 40 epochs
- 14 classes (2 trees + 12 defects)

## First Time Setup

### 1. Install Python
Download and install Python 3.8 or newer from:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

**Important:** Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation!

### 2. Install Dependencies
Open Command Prompt in the project folder and run:
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or simply run `start_app.bat` - it will install dependencies automatically if needed.

### 3. Verify Installation
```cmd
python --version
pip list
```

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use Batch Files (Easiest)
1. Double-click `start_app.bat`
2. Wait for browser to open
3. Choose your detection type
4. Upload images and analyze

### Option 2: Command Line
Open Command Prompt in project folder:

```cmd
REM Main app
streamlit run app.py

REM Simple detection
streamlit run inference_web.py

REM Two-stage detection
streamlit run two_stage_web.py

REM Training
python train_cpu.py
python train_defects.py
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Python is not recognized"
- Python is not in PATH
- Reinstall Python and check "Add Python to PATH"
- Or add manually: Settings → System → Advanced → Environment Variables

### "Module not found" errors
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Port already in use"
Another Streamlit app is running. Either:
- Close the other app
- Use a different port:
  ```cmd
  streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
  ```

### Model not found
- Train the models first using `train_trees.bat` or `train_defects.bat`
- Or download pre-trained weights from the repository

### Slow training
- Normal on CPU
- Training on GPU is much faster (requires CUDA-capable GPU)
- Consider using Google Colab for free GPU access

## Performance Tips

### For Faster Inference
- Use smaller image sizes (640x640 or less)
- Increase confidence threshold (fewer detections)
- Close other applications

### For Training
- Use GPU if available (10-50x faster)
- Reduce image size in training scripts
- Reduce batch size if running out of memory
- Use fewer epochs for testing

## Using GPU (Optional)

If you have an NVIDIA GPU:

1. Install CUDA Toolkit: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
2. Install PyTorch with CUDA:
   ```cmd
   pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
   ```
3. Verify GPU is detected:
   ```cmd
   python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
   ```

## Portable Installation

This project uses **relative paths**, meaning:
- ✅ No hardcoded paths
- ✅ Works from any folder
- ✅ Can be on USB drive
- ✅ Easy to share/backup
- ✅ Cross-platform compatible

Just copy the entire folder to any location and it will work!

## Getting Help

### Check Logs
When running batch files, any errors will be displayed.
Take a screenshot if you need help.

### Verify Setup
```cmd
python --version
pip list | findstr ultralytics
pip list | findstr streamlit
```

### Test Python Scripts Directly
```cmd
python -c "from ultralytics import YOLO; print('YOLO OK')"
python -c "import streamlit; print('Streamlit OK')"
```

## System Requirements

### Minimum
- Windows 10 or newer
- Python 3.8+
- 4GB RAM
- 2GB free disk space

### Recommended
- Windows 11
- Python 3.10+
- 8GB+ RAM
- NVIDIA GPU with 4GB+ VRAM (optional, for training)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run `start_app.bat`
2. ✅ Upload test images
3. ✅ Explore both detection modes
4. ✅ Train custom models if needed
5. ✅ Check training results in `runs/` folder
