# 🌲 Two-Stage Tree & Defect Detection System - Complete Guide

## 🎉 System Overview

You now have a sophisticated two-stage detection system that:
1. **Detects trees** in images using the simple tree model
2. **Identifies tree types and defects** using a 22-class specialized model
3. **Maps defects to trees** using spatial analysis
4. **Provides structured output** with tree names and their defects

## ✅ What's Been Created

### Training Scripts
- **`train_defects.py`** - Trains 22-class model for tree types + defects (CURRENTLY RUNNING)

### Detection System
- **`two_stage_detection.py`** - Command-line tool for two-stage detection
- **`two_stage_web.py`** - Web interface with Streamlit

### Dataset
- **`defects/dataset/`** - 288 annotated images with 22 classes
  - 11 tree types (ash, birch, bush, chestnut, larch, linden, maple, oak, pine, rowan, unknown_tree)
  - 11 defect types (crack, dead_bush, deadtree, dry_crone, leaned_tree, markedtree, markettree, rot, stem_damage, stem_rot, tree_hole)

### Documentation
- **`TWO_STAGE_DETECTION_README.md`** - Complete system documentation

## 🚀 Quick Start (After Training Completes)

### Step 1: Wait for Training to Complete
The defect model is currently training (30 epochs, ~2-3 hours on Apple M1 CPU).

Check progress in terminal. Training will save the model to:
```
runs/defects/tree_defects_detection2/weights/best.pt
```

### Step 2: Run Detection on an Image

```bash
# Command line
python two_stage_detection.py path/to/image.jpg

# Example with test image from tree dataset
python two_stage_detection.py dataset/test/images/istockphoto-1057939746-612x612_jpg.rf.e29922376d27e544f472d4c5aa4cb073.jpg
```

### Step 3: Launch Web Interface

```bash
python -m streamlit run two_stage_web.py
```

Then open: **http://localhost:8501**

## 🎯 Detection Classes

### Tree Types (11 classes)
| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ash | Ash trees |
| birch | Birch trees |
| bush | Bushes/shrubs |
| chestnut | Chestnut trees |
| larch | Larch trees |
| linden | Linden trees |
| maple | Maple trees |
| oak | Oak trees |
| pine | Pine trees |
| rowan | Rowan trees |
| unknown_tree | Unidentified tree species |

### Defect Types (11 classes)
| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| crack | Visible cracks in trunk/branches |
| dead_bush | Dead bushes/shrubs |
| deadtree | Completely dead tree |
| dry_crone | Dry or dead crown |
| leaned_tree | Dangerously leaning tree |
| markedtree | Tree marked for removal/attention |
| markettree | Tree marked for market/logging |
| rot | Visible rot damage |
| stem_damage | Trunk or stem damage |
| stem_rot | Rot in trunk/stem |
| tree_hole | Cavities or holes in tree |

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Detection Confidence
```python
# In two_stage_detection.py or web interface
tree_conf = 0.25      # Tree detection confidence (0.05-0.95)
defect_conf = 0.20    # Defect detection confidence (0.05-0.95)
```

**Recommendations:**
- **Tree confidence**: 0.25 (balanced)
- **Defect confidence**: 0.20 (slightly more sensitive to catch defects)
- **Lower values**: More detections but more false positives
- **Higher values**: Fewer detections but higher confidence

### Mapping Thresholds
```python
# IoU threshold for tree type matching
iou_threshold = 0.3    # Minimum overlap to match type to tree

# Spatial overlap for defect matching
overlap_threshold = 0.3  # Minimum overlap to assign defect to tree
```

## 🖥️ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Command Line
```bash
python two_stage_detection.py forest.jpg
```

Output:
- Console: Structured text report

    defect_model_path='runs/defects/tree_defects_detection2/weights/best.pt'
)

# Detect
results = detector.detect('forest.jpg', tree_conf=0.25, defect_conf=0.20)

# Process results
for tree in results['trees']:
    print(f"{tree['id']}: {tree['type']}")
    if tree['defects']:
        print(f"  Defects: {[d['type'] for d in tree['defects']]}")
    else:
        print(f"  Status: Healthy ✓")

## 🔍 How It Works

### Stage 1: Tree Detection
- Uses simple tree detection model (1 class)
- Finds all trees in the image
- Assigns unique IDs (Tree_1, Tree_2, etc.)
- Records bounding boxes and confidence

### Stage 2: Type & Defect Detection  
- Uses specialized 22-class model
- Detects both tree types AND defects
- No pre-filtering by tree location
- Detects everything in the full image

### Stage 3: Tree Type Mapping
- Calculates IoU between tree boxes and type detections
- Best matching type is assigned to each tree
- Minimum IoU threshold: 0.3
- Records type confidence score

### Stage 4: Defect Mapping
- Checks spatial relationship between defects and trees
- Uses both IoU and center point analysis
- Defect is assigned to tree if:
  - IoU > 0.3 OR
  - Defect center is inside tree box
- One defect can map to multiple trees if overlapping

### Stage 5: Output Generation
- Creates structured JSON with all information
- Generates visualization with bounding boxes
- Color coding: Green for trees, Red for defects
- Prints formatted console report

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### For Better Accuracy
1. **Train longer**: Increase epochs to 50-100
2. **Larger model**: Use yolo11s or yolo11m instead of yolo11n
3. **Larger images**: Increase imgsz from 640 to 800
4. **More data**: Add more training images if available

### For Faster Inference
1. **Keep yolo11n**: Smallest/fastest model
2. **Lower resolution**: Reduce imgsz to 416
3. **GPU**: Use GPU-trained models if GPU available
4. **Batch processing**: Process multiple images in parallel

### For Better Mapping
1. **Adjust IoU thresholds**: Lower for more matches, higher for strict matches
2. **Tune confidence**: Balance between false positives and false negatives
3. **Visual inspection**: Check results and adjust parameters

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Training Issues
```bash
# Check if training is still running
ps aux | grep train_defects.py

# View training logs
tail -f runs/defects/tree_defects_detection2/train.log

# Check disk space
df -h
```

### Model Not Found
```bash
# List available models
ls runs/detect/*/weights/best.pt
ls runs/defects/*/weights/best.pt

# If training completed, model should be at:
ls runs/defects/tree_defects_detection2/weights/best.pt
```

### Poor Detection Results
- **No trees detected**: Lower tree_conf to 0.15-0.20
- **No defects found**: Lower defect_conf to 0.10-0.15
- **Wrong tree types**: Check if types are in training data
- **Defects not mapping**: Verify trees are detected first

### Web Interface Issues
```bash
# Clear cache and restart
rm -rf ~/.streamlit/cache
python -m streamlit run two_stage_web.py --server.port=8502
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (After Training Completes)
1. ✅ Test detection on sample images
2. ✅ Launch web interface
3. ✅ Adjust confidence thresholds if needed
4. ✅ Process your own images

### Short Term
- Collect more training data for underrepresented classes
- Fine-tune confidence thresholds for your use case
- Create batch processing scripts for your workflow
- Integrate with existing systems

### Long Term
- Train larger models (yolo11s, yolo11m) for better accuracy
- Add severity scoring for defects
- Implement health status classification
- Deploy to production environment
- Create mobile app or web service
