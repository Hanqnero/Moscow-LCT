# Git LFS Setup Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully configured Git LFS and pushed all trained model weights to the remote repository.

## What Was Done

### 1. Git LFS Configuration
- ✅ Installed Git LFS hooks in repository
- ✅ Configured LFS to track `*.pt` files
- ✅ Configured LFS to track `runs/**/weights/*.pt` files
- ✅ Created `.gitattributes` file

### 2. Updated .gitignore
Updated the `.gitignore` file to:
- Exclude datasets (`dataset`, `defects/dataset`)
- Exclude most `.pt` files
- **Allow** weight files in `runs/**/weights/*.pt`
- **Allow** `yolo11n.pt` base model

### 3. Files Pushed with Git LFS (38 MB total)

**Model Weights (7 files):**
1. `yolo11n.pt` - Base YOLOv11n model
2. `runs/detect/tree_detection_cpu/weights/best.pt` - Tree detection (best)
3. `runs/detect/tree_detection_cpu/weights/last.pt` - Tree detection (last)
4. `runs/defects/tree_defects_detection/weights/best.pt` - Defect detection v1 (best)
5. `runs/defects/tree_defects_detection/weights/last.pt` - Defect detection v1 (last)
6. `runs/defects/tree_defects_detection2/weights/best.pt` - Defect detection v2 (best)
7. `runs/defects/tree_defects_detection2/weights/last.pt` - Defect detection v2 (last)

**Training Artifacts (84 files):**
- Confusion matrices
- Precision-Recall curves
- F1 curves
- Training/validation batch visualizations
- Results CSV files
- Training charts (results.png)
- Label distributions

### 4. Additional Files Committed
- `app.py` - Web app entrypoint
- `UPDATED_CLASSES_README.md` - Documentation for new class structure
- `WEB_APP_README.md` - Web app usage guide
- `start_app.sh` - Launch script
- Updated `two_stage_detection.py` - Support for 14 classes
- Updated `two_stage_web.py` - Updated UI for new classes

## Verification

### Check LFS Status
```bash
git lfs ls-files
```

Output shows 7 tracked files:
```
458deb8aac * runs/defects/tree_defects_detection/weights/best.pt
31b6e13e71 * runs/defects/tree_defects_detection/weights/last.pt
ee9ab03578 * runs/defects/tree_defects_detection2/weights/best.pt
688a2efc75 * runs/defects/tree_defects_detection2/weights/last.pt
48bf17d017 * runs/detect/tree_detection_cpu/weights/best.pt
6a6bdef5ea * runs/detect/tree_detection_cpu/weights/last.pt
0ebbc80d4a * yolo11n.pt
```

### Check Repository Status
```bash
git status
```

Shows: "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'." ✅

## How to Clone This Repository

When someone clones this repository, they need to have Git LFS installed:

```bash
# Install Git LFS first (if not already installed)
# macOS:
brew install git-lfs

# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install git-lfs

# Initialize Git LFS
git lfs install

# Clone the repository (LFS files will download automatically)
git clone https://github.com/Hanqnero/Moscow-LCT.git
cd Moscow-LCT

# Verify LFS files were downloaded
git lfs ls-files
```

## Benefits of Using Git LFS

1. **Version Control for Large Files** - Track changes to model weights over time
2. **Efficient Storage** - Only download the files you need
3. **Team Collaboration** - Everyone has access to the same trained models
4. **CI/CD Ready** - Automated systems can download models as needed
5. **Bandwidth Optimization** - LFS uses efficient transfer protocols

## Notes

- Dataset files are **not** included (excluded by .gitignore)
- Only trained weights and training artifacts are tracked
- New training runs should have their weights automatically tracked by LFS
- The base model `yolo11n.pt` is included for convenience

## Next Steps

Team members can now:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the models immediately without training
3. Use the web interface: `streamlit run app.py`
4. Continue training from existing weights
